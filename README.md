# TCP/IP Stack in Rust

Building a custom network from the ground-up as I teach myself computer networks!

Progress:
- [x] Ethernet
- [x] IPv4
- [x] ICMP
- [x] MILESTONE: write ping() to test reachability of the stack 
- [x] UDP datagram construction/deconstruction
- [ ] UDP send()
- [ ] UDP recv()
- [ ] TCP   

Ping implementation:
